# Credit-Card-Validator
Ever wondered how credit card numbers are verified? This cool project dives into the Luhn algorithm, a nifty checksum formula that validates credit card numbers by working its magic with digits.  #CreditCardValidator #LuhnAlgorithm #JavaProgramming #TechMagic #Fintech

This project is a simple Java program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm is a checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, primarily credit card numbers.

Features:
1.Validation Process:
The algorithm processes the credit card number from right to left, doubling every second digit.
If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, 9 is subtracted from the product.
The sum of all the digits is calculated, and if this sum is divisible by 10, the credit card number is considered valid.

2.Implementation:
The validateCreditCard method implements the Luhn algorithm.
The main method demonstrates the use of the validator with a sample credit card number.

3.Technology Stack:
Java: The program is written in Java, utilizing basic control structures and string manipulation.

This project showcases an understanding of algorithms, control flow, and Java programming skills. Itâ€™s a great example of practical applications of algorithmic concepts in everyday scenarios!
